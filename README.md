Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder where breathing starts and stops intermittenly. It can cause many issues while sleeping and increases the risk of strokes and heart attacks. Traditionally, sleep research relies on human visual scoring. However with the advancement of machine learning, sleep research can be become a highly automated process. The purpose of this respoitory is to automatically classify sleep stages specifically for people with sleep apnea. Using signals from polysomnography data, such as EEG, EMG, EOG, and ECG, we can score sleep records into five stages: wake state, REM, N1, N2, and N3.
